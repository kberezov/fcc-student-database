# fcc-student-database

This is a freecodecamp project called "Learn SQL by Building a Student Database Part 1". I was provided two files: courses.csv and students.csv.
For part one of the project, I created the students database and wrote the insert_data.sh script to insert the data from the two csv files into the database. The database is in students.sql. 
For part two of the project, I wrote the student_info.sh script which pulls specific information about the students from the students.sql database.
